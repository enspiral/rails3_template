<h3>Rails 3 the way we like it</h3>
<pre>

Currently rails3 balks at trying to run templates from a https url. You are going to have to fetch it via wget and run it locally.
Or you can clone the whole repo, it might be faster that way.

<code>rails new app_name -m http://github.com/enspiral/rails3_template/raw/master/main.rb</code></pre>
